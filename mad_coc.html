    <h1 style="text-align: center">MAD Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>Make A Difference (MAD) is a youth volunteer network working in shelter homes in twenty three cities across the country with a vision to create a positive learning ecosystem for children at risk. Volunteers teach English, conduct reading sessions, organizes personality development camps and career awareness workshops, which will equip and empower them for a better future.</p>

    <p>
        The main objective of this CODE OF CONDUCT is to protect children, to guide MADSTERS (employees and volunteers) in developing appropriate relationships with the children involved in the various programs and initiatives delivered by Make A Difference, to create a safe learning environment for the overall development and personal safety of the children and is also for establishing standards to protect and enhance the concept, the image, the credibility and the sustainability of Make A Difference as an organization. <br><br>
        As an employee/volunteer, you MUST:<br><br>
        1. Respect and uphold the personal safety of all children. Do not physically assault or abuse children.<br>
        2. Respect the Center Authorities and staff of MAD centers. Any rude behavior, comment is a threat to MAD&rsquo;s existence and continuity in the center. Any complaint of that nature will be severely dealt with.<br>
        3. Avoid physical proximity with a child that may make a child or a responsible observer feel uncomfortable. <br>
        4. If found under the influence of drugs or alcohol while representing MAD in any capacity will result in immediate termination of service.<br>
        5. As a representative of MAD, it is expected that your attire and personal grooming be appropriate for business purposes and for maintaining the proper atmosphere at the center in which you volunteer. Individual centers may issue specific dress code guidelines. <br>
        6. Avoid using language, making suggestions or offering advice which is inappropriate, offensive, threatening or abusive. Also refrain from telling jokes or narrating stories that are culturally demeaning, inappropriate and can cause discomfort to the children emotionally.<br>
        7. Do not bring friends who are not registered with MAD to any center where MAD is operational. If your friend(s) is/are interested to join MAD, kindly request him/her/them to attend the orientation before visiting any center.<br>
        8. Always display your MAD Cred identification card while entering a center or during fund raising activities.<br>
        9. Avoid using MAD&rsquo;s identity in any activity that you want to carry out in a personal capacity or with your friends who are not part of MAD, at any center where MAD is operational during the period of association with MAD or after.<br>
        10. Any money collected in the name of the organization towards a specific project/event should be handed over to the corresponding fellow (CFR/Events/DT/FC) within a maximum of 10 days from the date of collection from donor.<br>
        11. Sexual and other illegal harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome or offense sexual advances, requests for sexual favours, verbal and physical conduct of a sexual nature, and uninvited touching, or other behaviour that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. <br>
        12. All information about employees, volunteers and person&rsquo;s we work with are confidential. Unauthorized disclosure of all such information is considered a major violation.<br>
        13. Report Violations: It is collective responsibility of all volunteers and employees to promptly report all known or suspected violations of Code of Conduct or applicable laws and other policies, procedures, and guidelines prepared by MAD. Such violations can be reported via e-mail at compliance@makeadiff.in. Having knowledge of a violation of the CODE OF CONDUCT, and failure of reporting it will by itself be considered as a violation of the same. </p>

    <p>Allegations of non-compliance or reported violations with the Code of Conduct will be investigated whenever necessary and evaluated at proper level(s). Those found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct are subject to appropriate actions up to and including termination of volunteer relationship with MAD. Criminal misconduct may be referred to the appropriate legal authorities as per Law. <br>
